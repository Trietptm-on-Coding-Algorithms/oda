Live View
---------

In Live View, a user can enter machine code as ASCII hex characters in a text
area control. The disassembly of that machine code is then updated in real-time
in the main application area to the right. This provides a convenient interface
for disassembling small portions of code. On the sidebar, users can choose the
target architecture, the base address of the code, the endianness of the
machine, and other architecture-specific options, such as address size and data
size.
