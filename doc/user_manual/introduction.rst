Introduction

Welcome to ODA, the Online Disassembler!

ODA (onlinedisassembler.com) is a reverse engineering platform that provides a
collaborative reversing experience hosted in the cloud.  With ODA, groups of
people can collaborate on reversing the same binary and share their
contributions in real time.  ODA seeks to become “GitHub and Google Docs meets
IDA Pro”.

The typical workflow is to upload a file via the "File->Upload File" menu.
Once the file has been loaded, a user can begin to markup and annotate the
disassembly through right-click context menus as well as keyboard shortcuts.

Collaboration requires signing into ODA with a username and password.
